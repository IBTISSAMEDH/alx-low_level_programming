# 0x01-variables if else while

This project contains various C programs that demonstrate the use of variables, if/else statements, and loops in C.

## Files

- `0-positive_or_negative.c`: a program that assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
- `1-last_digit.c`: a program that assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
- `100-print_comb3.c`: a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by commas and spaces.
- `101-print_comb4.c`: a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits, separated by commas and spaces.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`: a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- `3-print_alphabets.c`: a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`: a program that prints
- `5-print_numbers.c`: a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- `6-print_numberz.c`: a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. The program can only use putchar and cannot use any variable of type char.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
- `8-print_base16.c`: a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- `9-print_comb.c`: a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by commas and spaces.
